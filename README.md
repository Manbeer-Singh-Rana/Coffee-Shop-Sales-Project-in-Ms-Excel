Dashboard Features
Sales Summary: A high-level summary of total daily, weekly, and monthly sales with a breakdown by product type (e.g., coffee, tea, pastries). Users can quickly identify how much revenue each category generates over time.

Popular Items and Product Trends: This section focuses on the most popular drinks and food items. It highlights top sellers and shows trends in customer preferences. The coffee shop can use this information to adjust inventory and marketing campaigns to promote specific products.

Sales by Time of Day: A visual representation of when sales peak throughout the day. It could include a bar chart or line graph that shows sales during morning, afternoon, and evening hours, helping the shop plan staffing and inventory needs based on demand.

Employee Performance: Tracks how much each employee sells in a given shift, comparing their performance to peers. This can motivate employees and help management identify top performers.

Profitability Overview: A section dedicated to profit margins, displaying the cost of ingredients, total revenue, and gross profit by item or category. It can also show which products are the most profitable versus those that need price adjustments.

Inventory Monitoring: Provides an overview of ingredient usage and stock levels for key items like coffee beans, milk, and pastries. It alerts when certain ingredients are running low and need replenishing, reducing the risk of stockouts.

Marketing and Promotions Analysis: Shows how discounts or promotions impact sales, helping the coffee shop understand which marketing strategies are working and which ones are less effective.

Interactive Filters and Slicers: Excel’s slicers will allow users to filter data by date, product type, or employee, offering flexibility in how they view and analyze sales data.

Data Sources
Point of Sale (POS) System: Transaction data, including item-level sales, timestamps, and payment methods.
Inventory Management System: Data on stock levels, ingredient usage, and product replenishment cycles.
Customer Feedback Surveys (if available): Information on customer satisfaction and product preferences.
Employee Shift Data: Information on staff shifts and sales performance during each shift.
Technology Stack
Microsoft Excel: Excel will be used to design the dashboard, utilizing features such as pivot tables, charts, and formulas to generate insights.
Pivot Tables: To summarize and aggregate large datasets, providing an easy way to break down sales by category, time, or employee.
Excel Charts: Line graphs, bar charts, pie charts, and heat maps will be used to visually represent the data.
Conditional Formatting: To highlight important KPIs such as underperforming products, top employees, or periods of low sales.
Slicers & Filters: For adding interactivity to the dashboard, allowing users to explore data from different angles (e.g., by time period, product type, or employee).
Formulas & Functions: Excel’s functions like SUMIF, AVERAGE, VLOOKUP, IF, and INDEX will be used for calculating totals, averages, and profitability metrics.
Project Workflow
Data Import & Cleaning: Gather sales and inventory data from the POS system and clean the dataset by removing duplicates, fixing formatting issues, and ensuring data consistency.
Data Modeling: Create relationships between datasets, such as linking sales data to inventory and employee data. Ensure that the data is structured for easy analysis.
Dashboard Design: Create visualizations and charts based on the key metrics. Design the layout of the dashboard so that it is easy to navigate and understand.
Performance Indicators: Use conditional formatting to highlight sales growth, top-selling products, and employee performance, making key insights stand out.
Testing & Validation: Test the dashboard to ensure that all metrics are calculated correctly and that the filters and slicers work as intended.
Deployment: Share the Excel file with the coffee shop’s management team and staff. Ensure that the dashboard is easy to use and accessible on different devices.
Ongoing Updates: Set up a process to regularly update the dashboard with new sales and inventory data, ensuring the information is always current and relevant.
